Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. The goal of this challenge is to code every day for 100 days and continuously improve my programming skills in DSA.


## Daily Progress

I'll be tweeting about my progress daily, so feel free to follow me on Twitter: [@abhayporwals](https://twitter.com/abhayporwals).


## Resources

During this challenge, I'll be using various resources to learn DSA concepts and improve my Java skills. Some of the resources I'll be referring to are:

- Online Course: [Kunal Kushwaha DSA Course]
- Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ]

## Getting Started

To run the code on your local machine, make sure you have Java JDK installed. Clone this repository, and run the Java file using the following command:

```bash
javac solution.java
java solution
```
